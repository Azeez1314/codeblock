Task:
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward. Write a function that checks for this.

const __isPalindrome = string => {
  const cleaned = string.replace(/\W/g, "").toLowerCase();

  return (
    cleaned ===
    cleaned
      .split("")
      .reverse()
      .join("")
  );
};

It first removes any non-word characters (such as spaces, punctuation, etc.) and converts the input string to lowercase, creating a "cleaned" version of the string.
It then checks if the "cleaned" string is the same as its reverse. If they are the same, it returns true, indicating a palindrome; otherwise, it returns false.


const isPalindrome = string => {
  const validCharacters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".split("");
  const stringCharacters = string
    .toLowerCase()
    .split("")
    .reduce(
      (characters, character) =>
        validCharacters.indexOf(character) > -1
          ? characters.concat(character)
          : characters,
      []
    );
  return stringCharacters.join("") === stringCharacters.reverse().join("");
};


isPalindrome Function:

It first defines a string called validCharacters containing all lowercase letters of the alphabet.
It converts the input string to lowercase and splits it into an array of characters.
It then uses the reduce method to filter out characters that are not in validCharacters. It iterates over each character in the input string and only keeps characters that are valid (letters).
Finally, it checks if the filtered characters are the same when read forwards and backwards, and it returns true if they are and false if they're not.


const _isPalindrome = string =>
  string
    .split("")
    .every((character, index) => character === string[string.length - 1 - index]);


_isPalindrome Function:

It splits the input string into an array of characters.
It uses the every method to check if each character at a given index is the same as the character at the corresponding index from the end of the string. If all characters match, it returns true, indicating a palindrome; otherwise, it returns false.
__isPalindrome Function:

In the simplest terms, all three functions are doing essentially the same thing: they are checking if the input string remains the same when you read it backwards. The first function (isPalindrome) does so with more detailed character filtering, while the other two functions (_isPalindrome and __isPalindrome) take a more direct approach by checking character by character for equality.
